# Spotazor

**Spotify Codes** can be scanned on mobile devices by launching the **Spotify** App on **iOS** and **Android**, then select **Search**, choose the **Camera** option and finally point the camera at the **Spotify Code** to then see the item in the **Spotify** App!

**Spotazor** is powered by [Spotify Embeds](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/embeds) and [Spotify Codes](https://www.spotifycodes.com/) and allows you to generate a **Spotify Embed** along with **Spotify Code** for any **Spotify** links from **Podcasts** to **Albums**!
